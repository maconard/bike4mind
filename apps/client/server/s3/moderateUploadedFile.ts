 * S3 retries the whole handler; the file stays `moderationStatus: 'pending'` (held,
 * fail-closed, recoverable) until either a retry succeeds or retries exhaust.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception is an unsupported format (`UnsupportedImageFormatError`):
 * a format neither Rekognition nor jimp can process is a deterministic, not transient,
